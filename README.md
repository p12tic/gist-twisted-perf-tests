Performance tests for @defer.inlineCallbacks changes
----------------------------------------------------

To run: modify `twisted_perf_all.sh` with correct paths to the two versions
of Twisted to compare and run the script.

Make sure the CPU is at constant frequency and that Turbo Boost is disabled.

To print a textual comparison of the produced results, use the `perf_compare.py`
script.
